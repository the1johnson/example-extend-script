# each-layer-add-composition-to-media-encoder-extend-script
My scene has 100+ mov layers that I needed to render out individually as multiple file types (low res gif, high res gif, and mp4). Not wanting to do that manually I wrote a script.

The script adds the composition to the media encoder showing each video file.

Here is what my working composition looked like: [image](https://i.imgur.com/ERrWN9r.png) {1395x769 ~160kb}
